# Reddit api app
This is one of the first projects I completed during the [Codecademy Full-Stack career course](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path-b/). It is a single page application that pulls posts from reddit using reddit's API to create a genre based feed. It is built with React and Redux, and can be viewed [here](https://bornedj.github.io/sports).
